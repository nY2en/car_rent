DESCRIPTION:

The application has a home page, a car catalog page, and a favorites page. The home page provides a general overview of the company's services, the car catalog page allows users to browse and filter cars, and the favorites page allows users to see the cars they have added to their favorites.

TECHNICAL TASK:

• According to the layout, implement a car rental announcement card. • 8 ads should be rendered on the first page of the catalog, and the rest of them - after clicking on the Load more button.

• If you click on the "heart" button on the ad card, it should be added to the list of favorites, and the color of the button should change.

• When updating the page, the final result of the user's actions should be recorded. That is, if you add an ad to your favorites and refresh the page, the button still remains in the "favorite ad" state with the appropriate color.

• If you click the heart button again, the ad should be removed from the list of favorites, and the color of the button should change to its original state.

• If you click on the Learn more button, a modal window should open with detailed information about the car and its rental conditions.

• The modal window should be closed by clicking on the button in the form of a "cross", by clicking on the backdrop or pressing the Esc key.

• In the code, the mileage of the car must be written with one value (for example, 4500). In the UI - displayed with a comma (4,500).

• The Rental car button should be implemented as a link that will allow the user to connect with the company by phone number +380730000000.
